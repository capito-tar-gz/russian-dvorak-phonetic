# russian-dvorak-phonetic
A Russian phonetic keyboard for Dvorak typists.

## Why create this?

I type in Dvorak on Mac OS, and there is no Russian phonetic option that maps to Dvorak keyboards. I've tried other solutions that have bugs, such as not mapping keys correctly on Shift or not having Dvorak when the Command key is held down. This is my solution for that.

## Installing

1. Download the bundle file to your computer and drop it into the `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder. 
2. Restart your computer.

The keyboard should be available under the Russian language section of your keyboard layout settings.

## Unresolved issues.
* I based this off of QWERTY Russian phonetic, which places the `«` and `»` keys where the `o` and `p` keys are on QWERTY. Since I mapped it over to Dvorak the same way, those two keys are not next to each other, which would be more convenient. This may be the case with other sets of keys?

## To-do
* Create a version for the sort that uses the Dvorak keyboard with QWERTY command key options?
* Testing!
